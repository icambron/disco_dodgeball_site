I haven't actually tested them, but I think these instructions are right:

 1. Clone the repository
 2. Make sure you have bundler installed: `gem install bundler`
 3. From the source directory, run `bundle install` to install the dependencies
 4. Run `middleman build` to generate the site HTML. It goes into the `build` directory

I built this with Ruby 2.0; I'm not as sure whether it runs on older versions, such as the ancient 1.8.7 that ships with OSX.
